# Machine-Learning-Design-Patterns-and-MLOps
This is a book that is primarily for ML engineers in the enterprise, not ML scientists in academia or industry research labs. which is going to focus on Machine Learning problems and How to chose the best  Pattern for our problem


This repo contains all projects & Tests & summary for each chapter
